# Moon-Mood
Reserching effect of lunar cycle on mood.
Now it's a program under development (it's my fun project or pet-project and used to study PyQT5).
Program objectives are 
  - to represent table for moon and mood data
  - to store and process numerical data (numeric mood scale and moon phases scale), 
  - to represent graph (sine-type for moon, simple-type for mood)
  - to average mood-line
  - to request moon data
